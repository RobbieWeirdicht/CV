    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
     <ul>
        <li><h2>Parenting</h2></li>
        <p>Less of a hobby and more of a lifestyle. Still parenting gives me lots of experience in work relevant skills like time management, priorization, stress managemnt, problem solving, tutoring and so on...</p>
        <li><h2>Street Workout</h2>
        <p>I started street workout in the spring of 2024 thanks to wife who is my partner in it too. Since then I do it every week, if possible three times. I love this kind of training becouse your progress is not measured by weighs instead it is measured by the complexity of your excersies that you can do.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h2>Gardening</h2>
        <p>Last year we started to make use of the rather large garden we have. We started with 3 beds with mixed results. This year we would likw to quadruple our effort and cultivate 12 beds and build a foil tent.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h2>Psychology</h2></li>
        <p>A recurring interest of mine, the exact nature of which is dependent on my life situation.</p>
        <li><h2>Games</h2></li>
        <p>It contains everything from pen and paper roleplaying games, borad games to video games. Recently I dipped my toe in game design and game design theory.</p>
     </ul>
